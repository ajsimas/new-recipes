# Spaghetti Carbonara

A classic Italian pasta dish that combines al dente spaghetti with a creamy sauce made from eggs, cheese, and crispy pancetta. This dish is simple yet incredibly flavorful.

## Ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 4 large eggs
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, freshly grated
- 50g Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, freshly grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the pasta water**: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. The water should be as salty as the sea.

2. **Cook the pancetta**: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the diced pancetta until it's crispy and golden brown, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.

3. **Cook the pasta**: Add the spaghetti to the boiling water and cook according to package directions until al dente (usually 8-10 minutes). Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

4. **Prepare the egg mixture**: In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated cheeses, and plenty of black pepper.

5. **Combine everything**: Working quickly, add the hot, drained pasta to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to coat with the fat. Remove from heat and immediately add the egg mixture, tossing constantly to create a creamy sauce. If needed, add a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce.

6. **Serve**: Divide among plates and garnish with extra cheese and black pepper. Serve immediately while hot.

## Tips

- The key to success is working quickly and not letting the eggs scramble
- Use the best quality ingredients you can find - it makes a difference
- Don't skip the reserved pasta water - it helps create the perfect sauce consistency
- Serve immediately as the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools
