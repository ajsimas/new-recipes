# French Onion Soup

A timeless French classic featuring deeply caramelized onions in a rich beef broth, topped with crusty bread and melted gruyere cheese. This comforting soup is perfect for cold weather.

## Ingredients

- 3 lbs yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 3 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 8 cups beef broth
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 baguette, sliced and toasted
- 2 cups gruyere cheese, grated
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Caramelize onions**: In a large Dutch oven, heat butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add onions, sugar, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 45-60 minutes until onions are deeply caramelized and golden brown.

2. **Add flour**: Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir for 1 minute to cook the flour.

3. **Add liquids**: Add white wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Add beef broth, bay leaves, and thyme.

4. **Simmer**: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

5. **Prepare bread**: Preheat broiler. Place baguette slices on a baking sheet and toast under broiler until golden brown.

6. **Assemble and broil**: Ladle soup into oven-safe bowls. Top with toasted bread slices and sprinkle with gruyere and parmesan cheese.

7. **Melt cheese**: Place bowls under broiler for 3-5 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.

8. **Serve**: Let cool for 2-3 minutes before serving.

## Tips

- Take your time caramelizing the onions - this is the key to great flavor
- Use a mix of yellow and sweet onions for depth of flavor
- The soup can be made ahead and reheated before adding bread and cheese
- Use oven-safe bowls for broiling the cheese topping
- For a vegetarian version, substitute vegetable broth for beef broth
- The soup freezes well without the bread and cheese topping
