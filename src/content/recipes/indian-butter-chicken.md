# Indian Butter Chicken

A classic Indian dish featuring tender chicken in a rich, creamy tomato sauce. This butter chicken (murgh makhani) is mildly spiced with aromatic spices and finished with cream and butter for a luxurious texture.

## Ingredients

### For the Marinade:
- 2 lbs chicken thighs, cut into pieces
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp garam masala
- 1 tbsp turmeric
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp coriander
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, grated
- Salt to taste

### For the Sauce:
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, grated
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tbsp garam masala
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. **Marinate chicken**: Combine all marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

2. **Cook chicken**: Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Place marinated chicken on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes until cooked through. Set aside.

3. **Prepare sauce**: Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until golden brown, about 8 minutes.

4. **Add aromatics**: Add garlic and ginger, cook for 2 minutes until fragrant.

5. **Add spices**: Add garam masala, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and cayenne. Cook for 1 minute until spices are fragrant.

6. **Add tomatoes**: Add tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes until sauce thickens.

7. **Finish sauce**: Add heavy cream and butter. Simmer for 5 minutes until sauce is rich and creamy.

8. **Combine**: Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes to heat through.

9. **Serve**: Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with basmati rice and naan bread.

## Tips

- Marinate the chicken overnight for maximum flavor
- Use full-fat yogurt for the marinade for better texture
- Adjust the cayenne pepper to control the heat level
- The sauce can be made ahead and frozen
- Serve with cooling raita and pickled onions
