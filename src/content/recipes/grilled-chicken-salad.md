# Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad

A light and refreshing salad featuring tender grilled chicken breast, crisp romaine lettuce, and a tangy Caesar dressing. Perfect for a healthy lunch or dinner.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Salad
- 2 heads romaine lettuce, chopped
- 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 cup red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, shaved

### For the Dressing
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp Parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the chicken**: Season the chicken breasts with olive oil, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Let marinate for 10 minutes.

2. **Grill the chicken**: Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the chicken for 6-8 minutes per side, or until cooked through (internal temperature 165Â°F). Let rest for 5 minutes, then slice.

3. **Make the dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together all dressing ingredients until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Assemble the salad**: In a large bowl, combine the chopped romaine, cherry tomatoes, and red onion.

5. **Serve**: Toss the salad with the dressing, top with sliced chicken and shaved Parmesan. Serve immediately.

## Tips

- Make sure the chicken is at room temperature before grilling
- Don't overcook the chicken - it should be juicy and tender
- You can make the dressing ahead of time and refrigerate it
- Add croutons for extra crunch if desired
