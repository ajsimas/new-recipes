# Mexican Street Corn

Authentic Mexican street corn (elote) featuring grilled corn on the cob slathered with creamy chili lime mayo and topped with crumbled cotija cheese. This popular street food is bursting with flavor and texture.

## Ingredients

- 6 ears of fresh corn, husks removed
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 lime, zested and juiced
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 cup cotija cheese, crumbled
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. **Prepare grill**: Preheat grill to medium-high heat (400-450Â°F).

2. **Make chili lime mayo**: In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, lime zest, lime juice, chili powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and cayenne pepper. Mix well and set aside.

3. **Grill corn**: Place corn directly on the grill grates. Grill for 8-10 minutes, turning every 2-3 minutes, until corn is charred and tender.

4. **Coat with mayo**: Remove corn from grill and immediately brush or spread the chili lime mayo mixture all over each ear of corn.

5. **Add toppings**: Sprinkle crumbled cotija cheese and chopped cilantro over the mayo-coated corn.

6. **Serve**: Serve immediately with lime wedges on the side for extra zing.

## Tips

- Use fresh, sweet corn for the best flavor
- Don't overcook the corn - it should still have a slight crunch
- The mayo mixture can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator
- For a spicier version, add more cayenne pepper or hot sauce
- If you don't have cotija cheese, feta cheese makes a good substitute
- Serve with extra lime wedges for guests to squeeze over their corn
