A fragrant and spicy Thai green curry featuring fresh vegetables in a creamy coconut milk sauce. This authentic dish balances heat, sweetness, and umami flavors perfectly.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp green curry paste
- 1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- 1 lb mixed vegetables (bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, snow peas)
- 1 cup bamboo shoots, sliced
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 1/2 cup Thai basil leaves
- 2 red chilies, sliced (optional)
- 1 lime, cut into wedges
- Cooked jasmine rice for serving

## Instructions

1. **Heat oil**: Heat vegetable oil in a large wok or deep skillet over medium-high heat.

2. **Fry curry paste**: Add green curry paste and fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, stirring constantly.

3. **Add coconut milk**: Pour in coconut milk and stir well to combine with the curry paste. Bring to a gentle simmer.

4. **Add broth**: Add vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes.

5. **Add vegetables**: Add mixed vegetables and bamboo shoots. Simmer for 8-10 minutes until vegetables are tender but still crisp.
