# Lemon Ricotta Pancakes

Delicate and fluffy pancakes made with creamy ricotta cheese and bright lemon flavor. These Italian-inspired pancakes are perfect for a special breakfast or brunch.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 3/4 cup milk
- 3 large eggs, separated
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 tbsp lemon zest
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp butter, melted
- Butter for cooking
- Maple syrup for serving
- Fresh berries for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

2. **Prepare wet ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together ricotta cheese, milk, egg yolks, lemon juice, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and melted butter.

3. **Combine mixtures**: Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Don't overmix - a few lumps are okay.

4. **Whip egg whites**: In a clean bowl, beat egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.

5. **Fold in egg whites**: Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the batter until just combined.

6. **Cook pancakes**: Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Brush with butter. Pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake.

7. **Flip and cook**: Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more until golden brown.

8. **Serve**: Serve immediately with maple syrup and fresh berries.

## Tips

- Use whole milk ricotta for the creamiest texture
- Don't overmix the batter - this will make the pancakes tough
- The egg whites add lightness and fluffiness to the pancakes
- Keep pancakes warm in a 200Â°F oven while cooking the rest
- These pancakes are best served fresh and hot
- You can make the batter ahead and refrigerate for up to 2 hours
- For extra lemon flavor, add more lemon zest to the batter
