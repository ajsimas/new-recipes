# Teriyaki Salmon

A restaurant-quality teriyaki salmon with a perfectly caramelized glaze. This dish features tender salmon fillets coated in a sweet and savory teriyaki sauce, finished with toasted sesame seeds.

## Ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets (6 oz each)
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 2 tbsp sake (or dry white wine)
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
- 2 green onions, sliced
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare teriyaki sauce**: In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, brown sugar, honey, ginger, and garlic. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.

2. **Thicken sauce**: In a small bowl, mix cornstarch with water. Add to the simmering sauce and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.

3. **Season salmon**: Pat salmon fillets dry and season with salt and pepper.

4. **Cook salmon**: Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place salmon skin-side down and cook for 4-5 minutes until skin is crispy.

5. **Flip and glaze**: Flip salmon and cook for 2-3 minutes. Brush generously with teriyaki sauce and cook for 1-2 more minutes.

6. **Finish**: Remove from heat and brush with remaining sauce. Let rest for 2 minutes.

7. **Serve**: Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and green onions. Serve with steamed rice and vegetables.

## Tips

- Use fresh salmon fillets for the best results
- Don't overcook the salmon - it should be slightly pink in the center
- Make extra teriyaki sauce to serve on the side
- Toast sesame seeds in a dry pan for enhanced flavor
- The sauce can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator
