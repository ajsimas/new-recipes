# Creamy Mushroom Risotto

A classic Italian risotto featuring earthy mushrooms, creamy arborio rice, and rich parmesan cheese. This comforting dish is perfect for a special dinner or date night.

## Ingredients

- 6 cups vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 cups arborio rice
- 1 lb mixed mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, oyster), sliced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare broth**: Heat vegetable broth in a saucepan and keep warm over low heat.

2. **Saut√© aromatics**: In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.

3. **Toast rice**: Add arborio rice and stir for 2-3 minutes until rice is translucent around the edges.

4. **Add wine**: Pour in white wine and stir until absorbed.

5. **Cook mushrooms**: Add mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 5 minutes.

6. **Add broth gradually**: Add 1 cup of warm broth and stir constantly until absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until rice is creamy and al dente (about 20-25 minutes).

7. **Finish**: Remove from heat and stir in parmesan cheese, parsley, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.

8. **Serve**: Let stand for 2 minutes before serving. The risotto should be creamy and slightly loose.

## Tips

- Use a wooden spoon to stir gently and avoid breaking the rice grains
- Keep the broth warm throughout the cooking process
- Don't rush the process - risotto requires patience and constant attention
- The rice should be al dente with a slight bite in the center
- Add a splash of broth if the risotto becomes too thick
