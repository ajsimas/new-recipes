# Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies

These are the perfect chocolate chip cookies - soft and chewy on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside. They're loaded with chocolate chips and have that classic homemade taste.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars**: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

4. **Add wet ingredients**: Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the vanilla extract.

5. **Combine with dry ingredients**: Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Don't overmix.

6. **Add chocolate chips**: Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.

7. **Form cookies**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. **Bake**: Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly underdone.

9. **Cool**: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips

- Don't overbake! The cookies should look slightly underdone when you take them out
- Let the butter come to room temperature for best results
- You can refrigerate the dough for 24 hours for even better flavor
- Store in an airtight container to keep them fresh
