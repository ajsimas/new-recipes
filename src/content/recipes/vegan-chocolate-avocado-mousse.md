# Vegan Chocolate Avocado Mousse

A decadent and healthy chocolate mousse that's completely vegan! This dessert uses ripe avocados to create a silky smooth texture while providing healthy fats and nutrients.

## Ingredients

- 2 ripe avocados, pitted and peeled
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (70% cocoa or higher)
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup almond milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt
- Fresh berries for garnish
- Mint leaves for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Melt chocolate**: Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until melted and smooth. Alternatively, melt in a double boiler.

2. **Prepare avocados**: Scoop the flesh from the avocados and place in a food processor or high-speed blender.

3. **Blend ingredients**: Add melted chocolate, maple syrup, cocoa powder, almond milk, vanilla extract, and salt to the food processor.

4. **Process until smooth**: Blend until completely smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides as needed. The mixture should be thick and mousse-like.

5. **Taste and adjust**: Taste the mousse and adjust sweetness if needed by adding more maple syrup.

6. **Chill**: Transfer to serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set.

7. **Serve**: Garnish with fresh berries and mint leaves before serving.

## Tips

- Use very ripe avocados for the smoothest texture
- Make sure the chocolate is completely melted before blending
- The mousse can be made up to 2 days ahead and stored in the refrigerator
- For a lighter texture, you can whip the mousse with a hand mixer after blending
- Serve with fresh fruit, nuts, or coconut whipped cream
- The mousse will firm up more as it chills
